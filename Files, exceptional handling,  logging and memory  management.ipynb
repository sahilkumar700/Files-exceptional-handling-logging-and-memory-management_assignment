    "\n",
    "1. Multithreading:\n",
    "Concept: In multithreading, multiple threads are executed within a single process. Each thread shares the same memory space, and threads \n",
    "can communicate with each other easily since they all operate in the same process.\n",
    "Concurrency Model: Threads within the same process share the same resources and memory, so multithreading is suitable for tasks that involed \n",
    " a lot of I/O operations (like reading/writing files, making network requests, etc.), but it doesn't provide true parallel execution of CPU-bound\n",
    " tasks due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "Use Case: Primarily used for I/O-bound tasks, such as file handling, network operations, or database interactions, where the program spends\n",
    "more time waiting for external resources than performing CPU-intensive calculations.\n",
    "GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): In CPython (the standard Python implementation), the GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode\n",
    "simultaneously. This limits the ability to fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks. However, I/O-bound tasks can still benefit from\n",
    "multithreading because while one thread is waiting (e.g., for I/O operations), another thread can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiprocessing:\n",
    "Concept: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are executed, and each process has its own memory space. These processes are independent of \n",
    "each other and run in parallel on separate CPU cores.\n",
    "Concurrency Model: Each process has its own memory and resources, so they do not share global variables. Communication between processes usually\n",
    "requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as queues or pipes.\n",
    "Use Case: Multiprocessing is ideal for CPU-bound tasks (such as complex calculations, data processing, etc.), where you want to fully utilize \n",
    "multiple CPU cores. Since each process runs in its own memory space and has its own Python interpreter, the GIL does not affect multiprocessing,\n",

    "Separation of Concerns: Logging allows you to track the program’s behavior without disrupting its functionality, unlike print statements.\n",
